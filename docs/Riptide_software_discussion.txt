1. If I want to write my own software to command the UUV, must I
terminate any MOOS or Riptide processes?

    pAntler

    MOOSDB

    pLogger

    iRiptideMicroUUV
    
    pNav

    pMarinePID

    uRiptideOLEDDisplay

    iRiptideSpartonIMU

    pRiptideMOOSMonitor

2. How does the operation of the UUV change when it submerges and
loses GPS fix?  Are there position and orientation variables for
status on the surface and different variables to use when
submerged?

3. From which variables should I get the current UTM position,
depth, heading, and speed when submerged? Any difference between
the prop spinning and stopped? Are any of these normalized to the
origin?

4. Which operational parameters does pMarinePID control?
    Speed, heading, depth?

5. Which variable sets the UUV forward speed, datatype, units,
max value? Required publish rate? Dependent on any other
variables?

6. Which variable sets the UUV heading, datatype, units, true or
magnetic?

7. Which variable sets the UUV depth, datatype, units?

8. Does the UUV calculate estimated position error when
submerged? Is there an indication of the need to reacquire GPS
fix?

9. Any Riptide logic which will automatically release the drop
weight?

10. What should I expect from the UUV's depth when the prop
isn't spinning?

11. Which variables indicate a fault with each Riptide UUV
subsystem?

    IRIPTIDEMICROUUV_STATUS
    MOOS_SYSTEM

12. Using the browser console and the Checkout page, what should
I expect for max rotation angle of each fin?

13. Which variable publishes the distance above the bottom,
datatype, units? What's the max usable range?

14. Which variable(s) give battery status, datatype, units?
What's the range of values?
