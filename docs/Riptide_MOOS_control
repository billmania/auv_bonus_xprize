There are three main variables for controlling the UUV.
They must be published together:

DESIRED_HEADING - true degrees
DESIRED_SPEED - meters per second
DESIRED_DEPTH - meters

and then two other variables must be set to False,
to enable DESIRED_SPEED above:

MOOS_MANUAL_OVERRIDE - False
MOOS_MANUAL_OVERIDE - False

The pose information about the UUV can be extracted from:

NAV_X - the easting
NAV_Y - the northing
NAV_HEADING - true degrees
NAV_DEPTH - meters
NAV_SPEED - meters per second


In order for the UUV to begin publishing the NAV_
variables, the following must occur:

1. GPS module functional and publishing GPS_ variables
2. depth module functional and publishing PS_DEPTH
3. IMU module functional and publishing IMU_HEADING

When DESIRED_SPEED is set to zero, assume the UUV will
slowly float to the surface.

Maximum angle on the control fins is 15 degrees.

An estimate of the position error can be found in
EKF_SIGMA. Both the x and y value should be less than 1.
