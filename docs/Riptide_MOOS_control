There appear to be four relevant variables for controlling the vehicle:
DESIRED_HEADING
DESIRED_SPEED
DESIRED_DEPTH
DESIRED_PITCH

DESIRED_SPEED is published to control the speed.

It's value is stored by pMarinePID in the variable m_desired_speed.

m_desired_speed is combined with m_current_speed, m_current_thrust,
and m_max_thrust to produce thrust.

ACTIVE_START is stored in m_has_control and must be True for
pMarinePID to publish a non-zero DESIRED_THRUST, along with
several other variables and values.

DESIRED_HEADING and DESIRED_SPEED must be received regularly and
are used to update m_time_of_last_helm_msg. Any NAV_ message must
be received regularly too, and is used to update m_time_of_last_nav_msg.

Both m_time_of_last_helm_msg and m_time_of_last_nav_msg must be
within TARDY_*_THRESHOLD for pMarinePID to publish a non-zero
DESIRED_THRUST.

Even after publishing True for ACTIVE_START and confirming the
rest of the system is publishing some NAV_ messages and publishing
DESIRED_SPEED every tenth of a second, pMarinePID continues to
publish 0.0 for DESIRED_THRUST.

If I kill pMarinePID and publish DESIRED_THRUST instead of DESIRED_SPEED,
I can spin the prop all day long.
