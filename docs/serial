use raspi-config to configure the serial port

OR

echo "enable_uart=1" >> /boot/config.txt
systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service
systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service
edit /boot/cmdline.txt #Remove console=serial0,115200

/dev/serial0 -> /dev/ttyS0

So on the Raspberry Pi 3, the UART hardware interface used for the
Bluetooth is named /dev/ttyAMA0 and the new UART connected to pins 8
and 10 on the GPIO connector J8 is named /dev/ttyS0.

Rasp Pi 3 GPIO serial pins:
8 Tx
9 Ground
10 Rx
